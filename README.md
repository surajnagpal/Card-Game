# PakBros

Start with Basic Classes:

First implement Card, Player, and CardDeck without threading
Focus on getting the basic game logic working in a single-threaded environment


Add Threading Gradually:

Once basic logic works, make classes thread-safe
Use synchronized methods/blocks where needed
Implement atomic operations for draw-discard actions


File I/O:

Implement early as it's crucial for testing
Create separate output files for each player and deck
Ensure proper formatting of output messages


Testing Strategy:

Start writing tests alongside development
Focus on unit tests first
Add integration tests as you connect components
Include thread safety tests last
